# Week 1 — C Programming Basics

### Concepts Learned
- Variables, data types, functions
- Loops and conditionals
- Compiling with clang and understanding debugging basics

### Reflections
- Moving from Scratch to C is a big jump
- Debugging felt hard but satisfying once solved
- Beginning to understand how low-level logic connects to real engineering work
- Wrote my first C program today — simple but exciting to see code run!
- Wrote a simple input/output program today and started understanding how user interaction works in C.
- Practiced writing my first function in C (square function) and started understanding how logic flows through a program.
- Practiced using a for loop to print numbers and began understanding how repeated logic works in C.
- Built a mini calculator using conditionals and user input — first time writing a small end-to-end program!
- Practiced writing a while loop and understood the difference between for and while loops.
- Learned how nested loops work by generating a simple multiplication table.
- Learned how to combine nested loops to draw shapes (pyramid), which improved my understanding of row-column logic.
