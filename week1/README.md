# Week 1 — C Programming Basics

### Concepts Learned
- Variables, data types, functions
- Loops and conditionals
- Compiling with clang and understanding debugging basics

### Reflections
- Moving from Scratch to C is a big jump
- Debugging felt hard but satisfying once solved
- Beginning to understand how low-level logic connects to real engineering work
- Wrote my first C program today — simple but exciting to see code run!
- Wrote a simple input/output program today and started understanding how user interaction works in C.
