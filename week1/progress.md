# Week 1 Progress Summary

## Overview
In Week 1, I transitioned from visual programming (Scratch) to writing real C code.
This week focused on core fundamentals: variables, data types, input/output, functions,
conditionals, loops, and problem decomposition.

## What I Built
### 1. hello.c  
- My first compiled C program  
- Learned how `printf` works and how C programs run  

### 2. name.c  
- Practiced input/output  
- Learned how to accept user input and work with strings  

### 3. square.c  
- Wrote my first C function  
- Understood how arguments and return values work  

### 4. loop.c  
- Practiced `for` loops  
- Learned how to repeat logic a fixed number of times  

### 5. while-loop.c  
- Practiced `while` loops  
- Understood how condition-based repetition works  

### 6. mini-calculator.c  
- First small “end-to-end” program  
- Used conditionals (`if/else`) to perform different operations  
- Handled user input and basic error checking  

### 7. multiplication-table.c  
- Practiced nested loops  
- Learned row/column logic and basic formatting  

### 8. pyramid.c  
- Applied nested loops to print a shape  
- Reinforced understanding of loops, spacing, and pattern printing  

## Key Skills Gained
- Writing and compiling C programs  
- Working with variables, functions, loops, and conditionals  
- Understanding program flow and debugging basics  
- Beginning to think in structured, logical steps  
- Seeing how programming connects to my daily technical recruiting work  

## Reflection
This was my first week writing actual code, and I learned far more than expected.  
C felt challenging at first, but building small programs helped everything click.
I’m starting to understand how engineers think when designing systems.  
This motivates me to continue building my CS fundamentals and prepare for more advanced coursework.
