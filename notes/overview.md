# Overview Notes

## Why I'm learning CS50

I’m starting CS50 because I want a solid and disciplined foundation in computer science.  
As a Senior TA Manager working with AI, RL, LLM, and Gameplay Engineering teams,  
I often evaluate highly technical roles, and I want to truly understand the systems behind them.  
This course is my first structured step toward building real programming fundamentals  
and preparing myself for a future master’s degree in Computer Science.

More notes will be added here as I progress week by week.

## What I learned in my first week

In the first week of learning CS50, I built foundational skills in C programming, 
including variables, functions, basic input/output, loops, and conditional logic. 
I also learned how to structure small programs and break problems into smaller steps.  
Most importantly, I realized how computational thinking applies to my daily work in 
technical recruiting and how programming logic mirrors real engineering workflows.  
This motivates me to continue building my CS fundamentals step by step.
