# Overview Notes

## Why I'm learning CS50

I’m starting CS50 because I want a solid and disciplined foundation in computer science.  
As a Senior TA Manager working with AI, RL, LLM, and Gameplay Engineering teams,  
I often evaluate highly technical roles, and I want to truly understand the systems behind them.  
This course is my first structured step toward building real programming fundamentals  
and preparing myself for a future master’s degree in Computer Science.

More notes will be added here as I progress week by week.
