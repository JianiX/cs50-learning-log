# Week 0 — Scratch & Computational Thinking

### Concepts Learned
- What a program is
- Basic logic and problem decomposition
- Introduction to Scratch

### Reflections
- First time building something visual
- Understanding loops and events was fun and intuitive
- Noticed how computational thinking applies to recruiting workflows too
- Added Scratch project idea notes today and started thinking about how loops/events can map to real technical workflows.

### Files
(Will upload screenshots of my Scratch project soon)
