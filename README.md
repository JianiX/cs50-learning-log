# CS50 Learning Log

This repository documents my journey as I build my computer science fundamentals from scratch through Harvard’s CS50.  

I am currently a Senior Talent Acquisition Manager working closely with AI, RL, LLM, and Gameplay Engineering teams.  
To better understand the technical systems I recruit for — and to prepare for a future Computer Science master’s program —  
I’m completing CS50 as my foundation course.

This repo contains:

### 📘 Weekly Progress
- Notes and summaries from each week  
- Reflections on concepts I found challenging or exciting  
- Screenshots and explanations of debugging steps  

### 💻 Code Exercises
- All labs and problem sets  
- My own Python/C practice scripts  
- Experiments with data structures, algorithms, and logic  

### 🎯 Learning Goals
- Build strong programming fundamentals (Python + C)  
- Develop computational thinking  
- Strengthen my foundation for future advanced CS study  
- Gain hands-on experience to support my AI-related recruiting and product work
